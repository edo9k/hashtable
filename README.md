# hashtable

In this repo I'm saving all the code produced from following a tutorial on hashtables. I believe writing a hashtable in C can help on understanding how they work. And they are fundamental building block for a lot of technology we rely on, it's a worthwhile endeavour learning a bit more about this data structure.

I'm following this tutorial: https://github.com/jamesroutley/write-a-hash-table
